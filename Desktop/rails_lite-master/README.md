# Using The Specs

Some specs have been written to guide you towards the lite. There are
rspec specs in the `spec` directory and demo servers for you to try
in the `bin` directory.

## Suggested Order

0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/controller_base_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/session_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/params_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/router_spec.rb`
0.  `bundle exec rspec spec/integration_spec.rb`

Run `bundle exec rspec` to run all the spec files.
